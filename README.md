<h1>Phone Directory Application</h1>

<p>This project is a <strong>Phone Directory</strong> application that includes the following features:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>CRUD Operations:</strong> The application allows you to Create, Read, Update, and Delete contacts in the directory.</li>
    <li><strong>Image Handling:</strong> Includes functionality for uploading, storing, and displaying contact images. If no image is uploaded, a default image is shown.</li>

    <li><strong>Search Functionality:</strong> The application includes a search bar that allows users to search for contacts by their name or phone number, making it easy to find specific contacts.</li>
    <li><strong>CSV Export:</strong> Users can export their contacts into a CSV file. There are two options available:
        <ul>
            <li><em>Download All:</em> Export all contacts in the directory.</li>
            <li><em>Download Filtered:</em> Export only the contacts that match the current search criteria.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>This application provides an efficient way to manage and maintain your contacts, with additional features to ensure that no contact data is lost and that the data can be easily retrieved and exported.</p>
